# Welcome to Session 1

## Outline

In this session we will

- make sure [R & RStudio](https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/) are up and running on all of your machines,
- show why we like R,
- introduce you to RStudio's User Interface,
- demonstrate some basic concepts and data structures.

## Getting started

## Why we like R {.smaller}

**Scripts vs. WYSIWYG (Excel or SPSS)**

Analyses conducted in R are transparent, easily shareable, and reproducible. This helps not only others to run and understand your code but also your future selves.

**Open Source**

R is 100% free of charge and as a result, has a huge support community. it means that a huge community of R programmers will constantly develop an distribute new R functionality. It also means that you find a lot of help online as others ran into the same problems as you do.

**Versatility**

Yes, R is not Python. You can still use it to do a lot of stuff. If you can imagine an analytical task, you can almost certainly implement (and automate) it in R.

**RStudio**

RStudio helps you write R code. You can easily and seamlessly organize and combine R code, analyses, plots, and written text into elegant documents all in one place.

## Examples & Use Cases

- [Dashboards](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/jjallaire/htmlwidgets-highcharter/htmlwidgets-highcharter.html#sales-by-category)
- [Master Thesis](https://howquez.github.io/Are-there-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/Predictions.html#the-self-interested-agents-expected-utility) [& Research Paper](https://github.com/Howquez/coopUncertainty/blob/main/analysis/quarto/paper.pdf)
- [Fraud Detection](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/334864_28050f7860dd4927a596872f0cd52401.html)
- [These Slides](https://github.com/Howquez/r-basics/blob/main/session_1.qmd)


## R & RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It helps the user effectively use R by making things easier with features such as:

- Syntax highlighting,
- Code completion,
- Smart indentation,
- Workspaces (more on that later), etc.


## RStudio GUI {.smaller}

Opening RStudio, you will see four window panes:

- bottom left: The **Console** executes code. You can use it to test code that is not saved.
- upper left: The **Source** opens your scripts, markdown documents or notebooks. It is the one you'll use the most as it allows you to write and save both comments and code. You have to actively run the code, though.
- upper right: The **Environment Pane** displays the objects (e.g. data, variables, custom functions) you can access in your current memory.
- bottom right: This pane shows you many different, yet important, tabs. You can browse your directory, view plots, get help and see installed packages.

## Scripts, Markdown & Project {.smaller}

- Scripts are a great way to document _how_ you analyzed your data.
- Like a recipe, scripts make it easy (for you and others) to reproduce your process _exactly_.
- You can also use RMarkdown, which allows you to blend code chunks with text.^[Which is great for reports and quantitative master theses, for instance.]
- To make your code even more organized and reproducible, use R Projects (We'll show an example).

## Computational Empathy {.smaller}

Know your audience, i.e. yourself. And don't be naive.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#
# Dear programmer:
# When I wrote this code, only god and I knew how it worked.
# Now, only god knows it!
#
# Therefore, if you are trying to optimize this routine
# and it fails (most surely), please increase this counter
# as a warning for the next person
#
# total_hours_wasted_here = 254
#
```

## Operators

::: {layout-ncol=2}

In the most simple form, R is an advanced calculator. Operators are symbols you know from any other program (Excel, etc.), such as `+` or `-`.

| Operation | Description      |
|-----------|------------------|
| x + y     | Addition         |
| x - y     | Subtraction      |
| x * y     | Multiplication   |
| x / y     | Division         |
| x ^ y     | Exponentiation   |
| x %/% y   | Integer Division |
| x %% y    | Remainder        |

:::

## Algebra {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

2+2
2 * 4
2^4
2 + (2 * 3) ^ 2
(1 + 3) / 2 + 45
13 %/% 3
13 %% 5
```

```{r echo = TRUE}
a <- 2+2
a + 2
```

## Data Types {.smaller}

## Boolean Stuff {.smaller}

| Operation | Description           | Output                                                       |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| x < y     | Less than             | TRUE if x is smaller than y. FALSE otherwhise                |
| x <= y    | Less or equal than    | TRUE if x is smaller or equal than y. FALSE otherwhise       |
| x > y     | Greater than          | TRUE if x is greater than y. FALSE otherwhise                |
| x >= y    | Greater or equal than | TRUE if x is greater or equal than y. FALSE otherwhise       |
| x == y    | Exactly equal to      | TRUE if and only if x is equal to y. FALSE otherwhise        |
| x != y    | Not equal to          | TRUE if and only if x is not equal to y. FALSE otherwhise    |
|           |                       |                                                              |
| !x        | Negation              | TRUE if x is equal to FALSE or 0. FALSE otherwhise           |
| x \| y    | OR                    | TRUE if x or y or both are TRUE . FALSE otherwhise           |
| x & y     | AND                   | TRUE if and only if x and y are both TRUE . FALSE otherwhise |


## Boolean Stuff 

::: {layout-ncol=2}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

3 < 4
3 >= 4
3 == 4
3 != 4

!TRUE
TRUE | FALSE
TRUE & FALSE
```

A Boolean expression is a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE.

## Assign Values to Variables {.smaller}

## Naming Conventions


- Variable and function names should be lowercase. 
- Use an underscore `_` to separate words within a name. 
- Strive for names that are concise and meaningful (this is not easy!).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Good
day_one
day_1

# Bad
first_day_of_the_month
dayone
```

## Naming Conventions

Where possible, avoid using names of existing functions and variables. Doing so will cause confusion for the readers of your code.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Bad
T <- FALSE
c <- 10
mean <- function(x) sum(x)
```

Also, try to avoid special symbols such as `+`, for example. If you really need them, you can escape them using the back tick ` 

## Naming Conventions

Most importantly, be careful

## Vectors {.smaller}

## Functions

## Packages

- Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.

- The comprehensive R Archive Network currently features [18.694 packages](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html).

- The majority of packages is quite niche-specific.

- To get started, we'll show you how to install [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

## {background-image="https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R/img/tidyverse_website.png" background-size="contain" background-repeat="no-repeat"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

#
# run this only once
install.packages("package_name")
#
# run this at the beginning of each session (if needed)
library(package_name)
#
#
# your turn: install & load tidyverse
```

## The %>% Operator {background-image="https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/logo.png" background-size="contain" background-repeat="no-repeat"}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, NA)
#
as.character(mean(a, na.rm = TRUE))
#
# We can do the same with the so called pipe operator %>% 
# Stems from the mgrittr package and is included in the tidyverse
#
a %>% mean(na.rm = TRUE) %>% as.character()
```

## How to get Help? {.smaller}

Assume you want to learn how to use the `mean()` function.

- `?mean` or `help(mean)`
- Use [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16801340/mean-in-r-by-using-mean)

## Workspace & Environment

## Exercise {.smaller}

## Ressources 

swirl is a great start as it teaches you R interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console! Run the following code to get started.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("swirl") # install this package once
library(swirl)
siwrl()
```

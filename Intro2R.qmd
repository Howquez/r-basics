## Why we like R

> R is unique in that it is not general-purpose. It does not compromise by trying to do a lot of things. It does a few things very well, mainly statistical analysis and data visualization. [-codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-r-used-for/)

Thanks to its built in function and additional packages, R is a great tool for:

- [Analyses]()
- [Data Visualization](http://estebanmoro.org/post/2020-10-19-personal-art-map-with-r/)
- [Post Cards](https://jnolis.com/blog/introducing_ggirl/)

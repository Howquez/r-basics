This, however, requires you to organize your code in so calles _code chunks_.\n\nWhile they show up in your source document (the `.Rmd` file), you cand hide them in the corresponding output format (such as the `.html` file).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to, you can also show them using `echo = TRUE`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install this package once, it'll then install and load all remaining packages\n# install.packages(\"pacman\")\n\npacman::p_load(magrittr, data.table, ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Data\n\nIn this document, we read some data from a public goods experiment that is stored in `../data/experiment.csv` and assign it to a variable we call `GMTV`.\n\n**Note:** Don't mind the interpretation of the data for the moment. We just want to showcase what you can do with it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Gini coefficient\n\nHaving the data, we can process it a little...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGINI <- GMTV[,\n             lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE),\n             by = c(\"round\", \"student\"),\n             .SDcols = \"gini\"]\n```\n:::\n\n\n...before we visualize it using the infamous `ggplot()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = GINI, \n       aes(x = round, y = gini, fill = student, color = student, lty = student)) +\n          layout +\n          theme(legend.position=\"bottom\") +\n          geom_line(show.legend=FALSE) +\n          geom_point() +\n          scale_x_continuous(name=\"\",  breaks = 1:10) +\n          scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.25), expand = c(0, 0)) +\n          labs(y = \"Gini Coefficient\") +\n          scale_color_manual(values = colors)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exercise_1_files/figure-html/giniPlot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nApparently, we have some sort of time series data. The plot above shows the Gini coeeficient measuring inequality between two samples (stundent and non-students) over time.\n\n## Contributions over time\n\nWe can create a similar plot and show a different variable easily. This time, we'll hide the corresponding code chunk.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exercise_1_files/figure-html/contributionPlot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
